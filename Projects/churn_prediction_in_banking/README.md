![265384900-2a1e89ce-8cbb-422b-8285-b5521215fa4e](https://github.com/huseyincenik/deep_learning/assets/127469334/e5766880-8090-43d0-84f4-1d6e1a837572)

## Model Prediction Process
- The predictive power of the model is driven by deep learning techniques, allowing it to capture intricate patterns in the data.
- New data for prediction is fed into the trained model, leveraging its ability to generalize from the patterns learned during training.
- The model's output provides a binary prediction, indicating whether a customer is likely to close their account (1) or retain it (0).
- This deep learning approach ensures a nuanced understanding of customer behavior, contributing to robust predictions in the dynamic banking landscape.
